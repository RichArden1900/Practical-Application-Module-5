### Analysis Result
After reviewing the data using python and the libraries in it. 
- My conclusion that the acceptance rate of the coupon is 56%
- Carry out & Take away coupon has the biggest acceptance rate rather than the other coupon type more than 70%
- Passenger who accept bar coupon are the drivers who between 25 and 30 years old and going to the bar more than 1 time for a month will accept the coupon. 
- Passenger who accept the coffeehouse coupon are the drivers who below 21 years old and the weather they travel has to be sunny weather and they should have going to the coffee house for 3 or more times per month
